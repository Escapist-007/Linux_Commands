## `tr` command with examples

The tr (translate) command in UNIX is a `command line utility` for translating or deleting characters. <br />
It supports a range of transformations including : <br />
 * Uppercase to Lowercase / Lowercase to Uppercase, 
 * Squeezing repeating characters / patterns, 
 * Deleting specific characters & 
 * Basic find and replace (Translate)

It can be used with UNIX pipes to support more complex translation.

#### Syntax :

 ```sh
    tr (option) set1 (set2)
 ```

Here, `option` and `set2` are optional.

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|   -c   | Complements the set of characters in string. [i.e. operations apply to characters not in the given set] |
|   -d   | Delete characters in the first set from the output |
|   -s   | Replaces repeated characters listed in the set1 with single occurrence |
|   -t   | Truncates set1 |

#### Usage :

   * **How to convert `lower case` to `upper case` ?**
   
 ```sh
    $ echo "Echo is used to print lines" | tr [a-z] [A-Z]
    Output: ECHO IS USED TO PRINT LINES
 ```
**Or** <br />
  To convert from lower case to upper case the predefined sets in `tr` can be used. The `[:lower:]` set matches any lower case character. The `[:upper:]` set matches any uppercase character. To convert from lower to upper these can be used.
    
 ```sh
    $ echo "Echo is used to print lines" | tr [:lower:] [:upper:]
    Output: ECHO IS USED TO PRINT LINES
 ```
 
 
 
   * **How to `squeeze` repetition of characters ?**
   
   To squeeze repeat occurrences of characters specified in a set use the `-s` option. 
   This removes repeated instances of a character.
   
   > In the following example, a string with too many spaces is squeezed to remove them. So, multiple spaces will be squeezed to a single space.
   
   ```sh
    $ echo 'too    many    spaces  here' | tr -s [:space:]
    Output: too many spaces here
    
    or
    
    $ echo 'too    many    spaces  here' | tr -s ' '
    Output: too many spaces here
    
   ```
   
   
   * **How to `delete` specific characters ?**
   
   To delete specific characters use the `-d` option. This option deletes characters in the `set1` specified.
  
   ```sh
     $ echo "Monir" | tr -d 'ri' 
     Output: Mon
     $ echo 'Welcome to Feni, Bangladesh' | tr -d 'Welcome to,'
     Output: FniBangadsh
   ```
   
   >  The `tr` is relatively crude. For more complex patterns `sed` is a better option.
   
   
   * **How to `translate` :- `space` to `tabs` ?**
   
  
   ```sh
     $ echo "Welcome To Bangladesh" | tr [:space:] '\t'
     Output: Welcome	To	Bangladesh
   ```
   * **How to `translate` :- `braces` into `parenthesis` ?**
   
   ```sh
     $ echo "{Welcome}" | tr '{}' '()'
     Output: (Welcome)
   ```

  * **How to remove all the `digits` from the string ?**
  ```sh
     $ echo "My ID is 023" | tr -d [:digit:]
     Output: My ID is
     
     or
     
     $ echo "My ID is 023" | tr -d [0-9]
     Output: My ID is
   ```
   
  * **How to search for a `complement` of a pattern ?** 
  > To search for a complement of a pattern use the `-c` option. Searching for a complement means searching for the inverse of the set specified. In the following example any character that is not ‘m’ / 'o' / 'n' / 'i' / 'r' is matched and translated to ‘a’. `-c` translate all ascii characters.
  > 
  ```sh
     $ echo 'abcmonirxyz' | tr -c 'monir' 'a'
     Output: aaamoniraaaa
   ```
> **NB:** When we use `echo` for printing a line it appends a `LF (\n)` at the end of that line. That is why we get 'a' 4 times at the end in the output instead of 3 times. We can check it by the below command :

  ```sh
     $ echo "monir" |  od -t x1c
   
     Output: 
      0000000  6d  6f  6e  69  72  0a
                m   o   n   i   r  \n
      0000006
  ```
> We can use `printf` if we want to avoid this situation.
 
 ```sh
     $ printf 'abcmonirxyz' | tr -c 'monir' 'a'
     Output: aaamoniraaa
   ```

> Searching for a complement pattern can effectively be used to pull out patterns from text. In the following example the `-c` option is combined with the `-d` 

Delete option to `extract a phone number`.
 ```sh
     $ echo 'Phone: 01840127929' | tr -cd [:digit:]
      Output: 01840127929
 ```
   
* **How to `truncate` a search pattern ?**

> To truncate the first set to the second set use the `-t` option. By default `tr` will repeat the last character of the second set if the first and second sets are `different lengths`.

```sh
   $ echo 'abcdefgh' | tr -t 'abcdefgh' '123'
   Output: 123defgh
```
> In the above example, 'a' will replaced by '1', 'b' will replaced by '2' and 'c' will replaced by '3'  

```sh
   $ echo 'abcdefgh' | tr 'abcdefgh' '123'
   Output: 12333333
```

   
* **How to build `translate pipeline` ?**
> The tr can be combined with pipes to build a translation pipeline. In the following example tr is used to clean a file named "File\ Name.txt". This removes backslashes, converts spaces to underscores and converts uppercase to lowercase. <br />

> For backslash "\\" we need to use '\\\\'


```sh
   $ echo 'File\ Name.txt' | tr -d '\\' | tr ' ' '_' | tr [A-Z] [a-z]
   Output: file_name.txt
```

  ### NB: 
 > [:lower:] = [a-z] <br />
 > [:upper:] = [A-Z] <br />
 > [:digit:] = [0-9] <br />
 > [:space:] = ' '  <br />
