# <font color=red> `awk`</font> command with examples

**awk** is a `scripting language` used for `manipulating data` and generating reports. The awk command programming language requires no compiling, and allows the user to use :
 * variables, 
 * numeric functions, 
 * string functions, and 
 * logical operators. <br />
 
> `awk` is abbreviated from the names of the developers – `Aho`, `Weinberger`, and `Kernighan`. It is one of the most prominent `text-processing utility` on GNU/Linux.
The version of awk that GNU/Linux distributes is written and maintained by the `Free Software Foundation (FSF)`; it is often referred to as `GNU awk`.

**awk** is a utility that enables a programmer to write tiny but effective programs in the form of statements that define text patterns that are to be searched for in `each line` of a document and the action that is to be taken when a match is found within a line. awk is mostly used for `pattern scanning and processing`. It searches one or more files to see if they contain lines that matches with the specified patterns and then performs the associated actions.

## Types of `awk` :

* awk  − Original awk from AT & T Laboratory.

* nawk − Newer and improved version of awk from AT & T Laboratory.

* gawk − It is `GNU awk`. All GNU/Linux distributions ship gawk. It is fully compatible with awk and nawk.

### Syntax :

  ```sh
    awk [options] 'selection _criteria  {action}' input-file > output-fil
 ```
**`awk` Operations:** <br />

(a) Scans a file line by line  <br />
(b) Splits each input line into `fields` <br />
(c) Compares input line/fields to pattern <br />
(d) Performs action(s) on matched lines

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|  -f file  | Reads the `awk program source` from the file, instead of from the first command line argument. |
| -v     | This option assigns a value to a variable before the program execution |

## Basic Workflow :
 `awk` follows a simple workflow − **Read, Execute, and Repeat**. <br/>
 
**Read** : <br/>
awk reads a line from the input stream (file, pipe, or stdin) and stores it in memory.

**Execute** : <br/>
All awk commands are applied sequentially on the input. By default awk execute commands on every line. We can restrict this by providing patterns. <br/>


**Repeat** : <br/>
This process repeats until the file reaches its end.

## Program Structure : <br/>

**BEGIN block**: <br/>

The syntax of the BEGIN block is as follows − <br/>
> BEGIN {awk-commands} 

The BEGIN block gets executed at program start-up. **It executes only once**. This is good place to `initialize variables`. **BEGIN** is an awk keyword and hence it must be in upper-case. Please note that this block is optional.

**Body Block**: <br/>
The syntax of the body block is as follows − <br/>

> /pattern/ {awk-commands}

The body block applies awk commands on every input line. By default, awk executes commands on every line. We can restrict this by providing patterns. Note that there are no keywords for the Body block.

**END Block** :<br/>

The syntax of the END block is as follows −

> END {awk-commands}
> 
The END block executes at the end of the program. END is an awk keyword and hence it must be in upper-case. Please note that this block is optional.

## Built-In Variables In awk :

awk’s built-in variables include the `field variables—$1, $2, $3, and so on ($0 is the entire line)` — that break a line of text into individual words or pieces called fields.

**NR**: NR command keeps a current count of the `number of input records`. Remember that records are usually lines.

**NF**: NF command keeps a count of the `number of fields` within the current input record.

**FS**: FS command contains the `field separator character` which is used to divide fields on the input line. The default is `white space`, meaning space and tab characters. FS can be reassigned to another character (typically in BEGIN) to change the field separator.

**RS**: RS command stores the current `record separator character`. Since, by default, an input line is the input record, the default record separator character is a newline.

**OFS**: OFS command stores the output field separator, which separates the fields when awk prints them. The default is a `blank space`. Whenever print has several parameters separated with commas, it will print the value of OFS in between each parameter.

**ORS**: ORS command stores the output record separator, which separates the output lines when awk prints them. The default is a `newline character`. 

## Usage :

##### Sample File : 
<font color=blue> `varsity.txt` </font>

>  1)  BUET Dhaka    Engineering
>  2)  DU   Dhaka    General
>  3)  IUT  Gazipur  Engineering
>  4)  KUET Khulna   Engineering
>  5)  CUET Chittagong Engineering
<br/>


Consider the `varsity.txt` file as input for all the examples.

<br/>

* **Default bahavior of `awk` ?**
   

    
   1. *Printing a file* : <br/>
 
 By default `awk` prints every line of data from the specified file.
 
 ```sh
 $ awk 'BEGIN {printf "Varsity Location Specialization\n"}  {print}' varsity.txt
 
 Output:
 
  Varsity Location Specialization
  1)  BUET Dhaka    Engineering
  2)  DU   Dhaka    General
  3)  IUT  Gazipur  Engineering
  4)  KUET Khulna   Engineering
  5)  CUET Chittagong Engineering

 ```
> In the above example, no pattern is given. So the actions are applicable to all the lines. At the start, `awk` prints the header from the `BEGIN` block. Then in the body block, it reads a line from a file and executes awk's `print` command which just prints the contents on the standard output stream. <br/>

<br/>

 2. *Print the lines which matches with the given pattern* : <br/>
 
 ```sh
 $ awk '/Dhaka/ {print}' varsity.txt
 
 Output:
 
 	1)  BUET Dhaka    Engineering
 	2)  DU   Dhaka    General
 ```
> In the above example, the awk command prints all the line which matches with the ‘Dhaka’. So it prints all the university located in 'Dhaka' from the given text file. <br/>

<br/>

 3. *Spliting a `Line` into `Fields`*  |  Printing `Column or Field`: <br/>
 
 For each record i.e line, the awk command splits the record delimited by `whitespace` character by default and stores it in the $n variables. If the line has 4 words, it will be stored in `$1`, `$2`, `$3` and `$4` respectively. Also, `$0` represents the whole line.
 ```sh
 $  awk '{print $1, $4}' varsity.txt
 
 Output:
 
 	1) Engineering
    2) General
    3) Engineering
    4) Engineering
    5) Engineering
 ```
 <br/>
 
 
 4. *Assigning a new `variable`* : <br/>
 
 ```sh
 $ awk -v name=Monir  'BEGIN {printf "Name = %s\n", name}'
 
 Output:
 
   Name = Monir

 ```
 <br/>
 
* **Use of awk's `Built-in Variables`?** <br/>


  1. *Printing all built-in variables in a file* : <br/>
 
`--dump-variables` prints a sorted list of global variables and their final values to file. The default file is **awkvars.out**.
 
 ```sh
 $ awk --dump-variables ''
 $ cat awkvars.out 
 
 Output:
 
ARGC: 1
ARGIND: 0
ARGV: array, 1 elements
BINMODE: 0
CONVFMT: "%.6g"
ENVIRON: array, 69 elements
ERRNO: ""
