## <font color=red> `grep`</font> command with examples

The **grep** command searches a file for a particular pattern of characters (regular expression) or specified strings, and displays all lines that contain that pattern or string.  <br />
> grep stands for  <font color=blue>`globally search for regular expression and print out`</font>

#### Syntax :

  ```sh
    grep [options] pattern [files]
 ```


| Option | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|   -i   | Search case insensitively |
|   -n   | Display the matched lines and their line numbers |
|   -v   | This prints out all the lines that **do not matches the pattern**|
|   -l   | Displays list of filenames only |
|   -w   | Match whole word |
|   -c   | This prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern |
| -e exp | Specifies expression with this option. Can use multiple times |
|   -o   | Print only the **matched parts of a matching line**, with each such part on a separate output line |
|-f file | Takes patterns from file, one per line |

### Usage :

##### Sample File : 
<font color=blue> `buet.txt` </font>

>   Bangladesh University of Engineering `and` Technology is known as `buet`.

>  `Buet` is the best public university in Bangladesh.

>  `BUET` was founded in 1912, `and` it focuses on the study of engr. `and` archi.

<br/>

<font color=blue> `test.txt` </font>

>   HELLO WORLD - BUET

>   hello world - buet

>   Hello World - Buet

Consider the `buet.txt` and `test.txt` files as input for all the examples.

   * **How to search a `pattern / string`  in `a file`/ `files` / `a directory` ?**
   

    
   1. Search for the given string in a single file : <br/>
 
 
 ```sh
 $ grep  versity  buet.txt
 
 Output:
 
 Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology is known as buet.
 Buet is the best public university in Bangladesh.
 ```
> The above example search the word `versity` in the given text file. `grep` command returns `every line` where it finds the given word as a `substring`. <br/>

> The search is always `case sensitive`.

<br/>

 2. Search for the given string in multiple files : <br/>

 ```sh
 $ grep  BUET  buet.txt  test.txt
 
Output: 

buet.txt: BUET was founded in 1912, and it focuses on the study of engr. and archi.
test.txt: HELLO WORLD - BUET

 ```
> The above example search the word `BUET` in the given files. `grep` command returns `every line` preceding with `file name` where it finds the given word as a `substring`. <br/>

> The search is always `case sensitive`.

<br/>

 3. Search for the given string in a `directory` : <br/>
 
  > grep "pattern"  "dircetory"

 `grep  BUET   *`    
 ( search the given word in the current directory and print the matched lines ) <br/>
 
 `grep -r BUET *`    
 ( search all the files under the current directory and its sub directory [recursive search] and print the matched lines)
 
 
 <font color=blue>`grep -l BUET *`</font>
 
 ( search the given word in the current directory and print the `file name` which has at least one matched lines )
 
<br/>

4. Case insensitive search :<br/>

 ```sh
 $ grep  -i  BUET  buet.txt  test.txt
 
Output: 

buet.txt: Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology is known as buet
buet.txt: Buet is the best public university in Bangladesh.
buet.txt: BUET was founded in 1912, and it focuses on the study of engr. and archi.
test.txt: HELLO WORLD - BUET
test.txt: hello world - buet
test.txt: Hello World - Buet
 ```
> The `-i` option enables to search for a string case insensitively in the give file. It matches the words like `BUET`, `Buet`, `buet`. It prints the matched line with file name. <br/>

<br/>



5. Showing line numbers :<br/>

 ```sh
 $ grep  -n  Buet  test.txt
 
Output: 

3:Hello World - Buet
 ```
> The `-n` option enables to show the matched lines and their line numbers. <br/>

<br/>

6. Inverse search :<br/>

 ```sh
 $ grep  -n Buet test.txt
 
>> 3:Hello World - Buet

$ grep  -nv Buet test.txt
 
>> 1:HELLO WORLD - BUET
    2:hello world - buet
 ```

> The `-v` option enables to show the lines having no match. <br/>


<br/>

7. Checking for the `whole word` in a file / `word search`:<br/>

 ```sh
 $ grep  versity  buet.txt
 
>> Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology is known as buet.
    Buet is the best public university in Bangladesh.

 $ grep  -w  versity  buet.txt  

>> No line is showed as the file does not contain the word `versity`

Or,

 $ grep  ' versity '  buet.txt  

>> No line is showed. 
 ```

> By default, grep matches the given string/pattern even if it found as a substring in a file. The `-w` option to grep makes it match only the whole words. <br/>

   * **How to count the number of lines which match ( `Line count` ) ?**
   ```sh
   $ grep  -c  and  buet.txt
   >> 2
   ```
> The `-c` option enables the line count. So, one can find the number of lines that
> matches the given string / pattern. 

  * **How to display only the `matched pattern` ?**
 
   ```sh
   $ grep  -o  versity  buet.txt
   
   >> versity
      versity
   ```
> By default, grep displays the entire line which has the matched string. We can make the grep to display only the matched string by using the `-o` option.

  * **How to count the number of words which exactly match ( `Word count` )  ?**
 
   ```sh
   $ grep -w 'and' buet.txt | grep -o 'and' | grep -c 'and'
   
   >> 3
   ```
> `buet.txt` file has 2 lines containing the word 'and' . The frequency of this word is 3 in these two lines.



* **How to specify multiple patterns / strings ?**
 
   ```sh
   $ grep -e BUET -e buet  test.txt
   
   >> HELLO WORLD - BUET
      hello world - buet
   ```

> The `-e` option is needed for giving multiple patterns / strings in the grep command.



* **How to take patterns from file, one per line ?**
 
   ```sh
   $  cat pattern.txt   [show the pattern.txt file]
   
   >> BUET
      buet

   $  grep -f pattern.txt  test.txt
   
   >> HELLO WORLD - BUET
      hello world - buet
   ```

> The `-f` option is needed for reading the patterns from a file.


* **How to get the lines that `start or end`  with a  `specific string`  ?**

    > The `^` regular expression pattern specifies the start of a line. This can be used in grep to match the lines which start with the given string or pattern.
    
    > The `$` regular expression pattern specifies the end of a line. This can be used in grep to match the lines which end with the given string or pattern.
  
   ```sh

   $  grep "^BUET" buet.txt
   
   >> BUET was founded in 1912, and it focuses on the study of engr. and archi.

      
   $  grep "buet.$" buet.txt
   
   >> Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology is known as buet.

   ```
